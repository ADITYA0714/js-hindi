// What is Js-Engine and Why it is called Js-Engine is in the browser?
// Ans : - 
// Every modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) comes with a built-in program called a JavaScript engine.

// This engine’s job is to read, understand, and execute JavaScript code that is part of a web page.

// Why is it called an engine?
// Because it is a runtime program specifically designed to parse (read) JavaScript, compile it into machine code, and run it quickly.

// You don’t have to install anything — it’s already “under the hood” of your browser.
